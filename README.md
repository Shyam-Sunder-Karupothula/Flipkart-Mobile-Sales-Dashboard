# 📊 Flipkart Mobile Sales Dashboard

This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing smartphone sales data from Flipkart to uncover pricing patterns, brand performance, and technical specification trends. The goal is to support data-driven business decisions in e-commerce and electronics retail domains.

## 📌 Project Description

Using data scraped from Flipkart (via **BeautifulSoup** and **Selenium**), I compiled key product information such as:

- Price  
- Reviews  
- RAM/ROM configurations  
- Display sizes  
- Processor types  
- Ratings  

The final dataset includes **120 smartphones across 16 brands**. After cleaning and transforming the data in **Excel**, I used **Power BI** to build a fully interactive dashboard that helps track pricing strategies, customer preferences, and technical trends.
