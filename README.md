üìä Flipkart Mobile Sales Dashboard
This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing smartphone sales data from Flipkart to uncover pricing patterns, brand performance, and technical specification trends. The goal is to support data-driven business decisions in e-commerce and electronics retail domains.

üìå Project Description
Using data scraped from Flipkart (via BeautifulSoup/Selenium), I compiled key product information such as price, reviews, RAM/ROM configurations, display sizes, processors, and ratings for 120 smartphones across 16 brands.

The cleaned dataset was then imported into Power BI where a fully interactive dashboard was built to track pricing strategies, customer preferences, and specification-wise trends.

üéØ Business Purpose
This dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for:

Retail strategy teams to identify best-selling brands and specifications.

Product managers to optimize product portfolios based on performance and price segmentation.

Marketing teams to understand what drives reviews and ratings.

Data analysts to monitor trends and generate insights without manual tracking.

üîç Key Insights from the Dashboard
Apple has the highest average pricing (~‚Çπ49K) but lower total reviews, indicating a premium market segment with less volume.

Vivo leads in customer engagement with 108 reviews, making it a key brand to monitor for volume strategy.

8GB‚Äì12GB RAM models capture the highest revenue share, implying mid to high-spec phones are most profitable.

Snapdragon processors dominate in terms of cumulative sales value (~‚Çπ1.6M), followed by generic or less branded chips.

Most popular screen sizes are between 6.0" and 6.8", which helps in understanding consumer form-factor preferences.

Despite Apple having 0 RAM listing (displayed as 'Not Available'), it still competes in high price brackets‚Äîhandled with a custom label to improve clarity in visuals.
